# Simple Calculator Android Application

# Author

# Features
The application provides basic calculation functionality – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, and square root in addition to providing buttons for numbers, decimal point, ‘Clear’, and backspace.


When the backspace button is long pressed, all the contents are cleared. Methods are created and reused to reduce code duplication. Compatibility classes are used to provide backwards compatibility for older android versions.
